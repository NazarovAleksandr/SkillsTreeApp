# SkillsTreeApp
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NazarovAleksandr/SkillsTreeApp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/NazarovAleksandr/SkillsTreeApp)

Built React+Mobx app from scratch, which represents concept of mobile/browser game which has some skill trees and runes.
It also has autotests, and support of different screen resolutions, but tested only on few android devices, lol.

Currently development in progress.
